    `DatasetWriter` and applies `static_data`. On the opening turn, samples that
    predate START — the inter-episode home command and any pre-reset frame — are
    dropped, while a genuine post-START value is kept; the producer's post-reset
    frame-0 arrives the next turn and is the first recorded sample. While open,
    each updated input signal (from `inputs`) is appended with the current
    timestamp from `clock`. `STOP_EPISODE` and `ABORT_EPISODE` are handled after
    that turn's inputs, so the trial's last frame is recorded before STOP
    finalizes the writer; samples timestamped after STOP — post-episode home or
    sensor data the async real path may queue — are dropped, and ABORT discards
    the episode. Invalid or out-of-order commands are ignored with a log message.

    `TimeMode` selects whether timestamps come from the control loop clock
    (`CLOCK`) or from the producing message (`MESSAGE`).

    ``virtual_time`` makes the recorder yield to ride the producer's clock — sim lockstep, where the
    simulator is the sole time-master — instead of pacing itself at ``poll_hz`` (real/background).
